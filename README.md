# An Efficient Classification Model using Fuzzy Rough Set Theory and Random Weight Neural Network

## Abstract  
This paper presents an efficient technique that uses Fuzzy Rough Set Theory (FRST) for feature selection and combines it with a Random Weight Neural Network (RWNN) classifier. The goal is to improve accuracy and speed for classifying high-dimensional, real-valued datasets. The proposed method shows better performance compared to other classifiers like KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, and Backpropagation Neural Networks.

## Features  
- Fuzzy rough set-based feature selection  
- Fast and accurate classification using RWNN  
- Works well on large-scale datasets  
- Outperforms traditional machine learning models

## Technologies  
- Fuzzy Rough Set Theory (FRST)  
- Random Weight Neural Network (RWNN)  
- Python / MATLAB (use whichever you used in your paper)  

## Results  
Experiments show that this model provides better generalization, higher accuracy, and faster processing than common classifiers.
